                    <p>We started by researching other calender apps on the market. We named calender apps we've used and/or heard of, and also searched in the Apple Store and Google Play for apps we haven't heard of.                     
                    </p>
                    <p>We saw some really fancy apps, like <strong class="serenity"><a href="https://us.moleskine.com/timepage/p0486" target="_blank">Timepage</a></strong> and <strong class="serenity"><a href="https://vantageby44.com/" target="_blank">Vantage Calendar</a></strong>. These apps have a really smooth interaction and awesome visual effects. But they can be hard to use for beginners. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Other apps we tested were more basic and easy to understand. Like Apple Calender, Google Calender and Fantastical. These apps provided the basic set of functions that users would need, but in different ways.

                        <p>Our app was designed based on a design language called Pear. Pear has its own style guide and design system guidelines that we needed to follow.              
                        </p>
                        <p>The top panel, the font (and font size), and the color palette are provided in the design system. 
                        </p>
                        <p>We also saw the list and card view that might be useful in our design.

                <div class="description">
                    <p>Our app is a pre-installed app. So unlike the fancy apps we saw, our user group was people that purchase the Pear phone. Since this is a new, cutting edge phone, our users would be younger people that love new technology, or just want to be different/trendy.           
                    </p>
                    <p>To make the app useful for all the users, we didn't want it to be fancy. The app would be pretty basic, easy to start using, and cover all basic needs. Which means users should be able to add, view, and edit events, see and organize schedules, and get notices.
                    </p>
                    <p>We also wanted to make sure the flow and interaction of this app are smooth and efficient. When testing other apps, we realized some of them were harder to use becuase the flow was not well designed. And this is the main focus of our design, to offer basic functions in the easiest way.

                    <p>A monthly view, a weekly view, a daily view, and Add Event. Edit Event and View Event would be similar to add event.

                    <p>Daily view is presented with timelines so the users would be aware of when they are free, and when they are not.

                <div class="description">
                    <p>The first problem we encountered is how to navigate between all the different views we have. We thought about a navigation bar, a hidden side bar and some other "bar" navigations.               
                    </p>
                    <p>These would work, but they also took up a lot of space and we didn't want to make it over-crowded. Also, things like hidden bars did not exist in the system design guideline.
                    </p>
                    <p>So I proposed that we could try to include swipe. A lot calender apps we saw used swipe as their main way of interaction. And the design wouldn't be too complicated if we only use a little.
