                <img class="img-responsive" src="img/emp-1.png" alt="User Research Report">
                <div class="description">
                    <p>Because the goal of the user research is to find out if there is a problem, and I need many in-depth experiense and feelings people have about the problems, I decided to conduct the research using interviews.
                    </p>
                    <p>I interviewed three interviewees with the following basic problems and expanded to ask more detailed questions:
                    </p>
                    <p>Have you experienced times that you don’t know how to communicate the message you want appropriately (wording, tones)? 
                        Like giving advices, trying to make someone feel better, writing emails to strangers, asking someone to do something, etc. 
                        What happened and what method did you use to deal with it? Is the method helpful and why?
                    </p>
                    <p>In my problem interviews, all of my interviewees reported having this problem. 
                        They found that communicating with strangers, teammates, and professors were hard. 
                    </p>
                    <p>One interviewee mentioned that she had to google for templates before writing an email and tried to stay concise in tones when adding sentences to the templates. 
                        But she couldn’t find templates for personal communications. 
                        For personal communications like comforting others and providing advice, one interviewee mentioned she would add emojis to her message to add a tone. But her choice was very limited.
                    </p>
                </div>  
            </div>

                <div class="title1">Competitor Analysis</div>
                <div class="title2">Other Technologies Out There</div>

                <div class="description">
                    <p>I then researched for other technologies on the market that can help with composing messages and communicating. 
                    </p>
                    <p>One app that helps users compose their messages is <strong class="serenity"><a href="https://www.blog.google/products/gmail/subject-write-emails-faster-smart-compose-gmail/" target="_blank">Smart Compose</a></strong>. It is a feature Gmail offers that uses artificial intelligence to
                        understand typed text and suggest words and phrases to finish your sentences. But the function of Smart Compose is to cut back on repetitive writing and
                        save time for the user, not helping them about writing the email. Our problem is the user
                        needs to use a new style/tone of writing, but this feature can only suggest words and
                        phrases based on the style the user used previously.</p>
                    <p><strong class="serenity"><a href="https://www.crystalknows.com/" target="_blank">Crystal Knows</a></strong> is another relevant technology that has a lot of overlaps with our
                        project. Crystal is a tool that can predict anyone’s personality from their social media
                        profile or text samples they wrote and provide advices for communicating and interacting
                        with them. But its function is based on the person's personality instead of the current situation and emotions, so the problem it's solving is also different.
                    </p>
                    <p>But these technologies prove that natural language processing, artificial intelligence, and word suggestions can be used to solve these problems in real life.

                <div class="description">
                    <p>In the interview, the interviewees provided many situations they found difficult to communicate their thoughts. 
                        And the situations varied a lot, from one-to-one conversation to group chat, from messaging apps to writing emails. 
                        Based on the interview results, users need something that can be used in real-time and in all the possible cases of writing messages. 
                        I decided to use a third-party keyboard application because it can be used in all the applications after installed to replace the original keyboard.         
                    </p>
                    <p>The goal of communication is customized and inputted by the user. 
                        By tapping the button on the top-left corner of the keyboard, the user would be direct to a setting panel where he/she could input the goals.
                    </p>
                    <p>After applying the goals, the user can start composing his/her message, and the keyboard will offer real-time words/phrases suggestions. 
                        To make sure that the keyboard is easy to use and to reduce learning time, the basic design and interaction model needs to be similar to pre-existing designs that the users are already familiar with. 
                        So, the suggestion is provided in the way the auto-complete is provided in all the other keyboard applications. 
                        But instead of suggestions based on the letters, Empathy would offer suggestions based on the goal of the communication.

            <div class="section-lg" id ="TR">

                <div class="title2">Put the Solution to the Test</div>
                <img class="img-responsive" src="img/emp-4.png" alt="Design Draft">
                <div class="description">
                    <p>I conducted three usability tests in three different scenarios. 
                        Interviewee A didn't know how to write a thank-you note to a professor that helped her out for her project. 
                        Interviewee B wanted to send a message in the Capstone group chat to ask her teammates to check messages regularly and leave a response when they do without being pushy and harsh in her worlds.
                        Interviewee C wanted to write an email to talk with her professor before she drop his course and she didn't know how to do it.
                    </p>
                    <p>Most people thought the input section is too complex to use. 
                        Letting the users compose first and then analyze might be a good solution to the problem. 
                        Also I could combine the two solution, let the users select basic emotions and tones, then analyze the goal based on the message to double-check.
                        Besides preference priority mentioned by interviewee C, I also think saved plans is something I can add. 
                        All interviewees only used the keyboard once, and if they need to reuse the app and need to re-enter everything they might find the input section is even more annoying. Messages about things need to be done in a group chat will be send multiple times by users, so they should be able to save the plan and reuse.
                    </p>
                    <p>Interviewee A mentioned about the keyboard could help with the information part of the message like what to write. 
                        I thought this is worth considering because information can also influence the how the viewer feels about the message. 
                        Maybe I could offer some sentences for the users to use, but I’m not sure about templates since they are all-over internet and they are not really communicating what the writer wants to say.
                    </p>
                    <p>Another thing I realized from the two email scenarios, though nobody talked about it, is the app does not offer a whole page analyze. 
                        All analyzation happened within the keyboard, once the user selects the word/phrase it is settled. 
                        And I thought this might cause problems when using in real world, especially with long messages/emails.

                            for the user to customize, but one or two inputs are enough for the system to analyze the message and provide suggestions.

                        <p>Another update to reduce the number of inputs is the saved goals. 
                            The user can reuse previous goals in similar situations, so he/she doesn’t need to reset everything. 
                            For example, I can use one list of goals for all messages I sent in the same group chat. 
                            Also, for multiple related conversations, the user can modify a previous plan to reuse.
                        </p>
                        <p>To help the user decide on goals, I added a list of words and phrases to each goal for the user to choose from. 
                            For example, I can now choose from a list of emotions instead of thinking and trying to tell how I want the message to look like. 
                            In this way, the user doesn’t need to summarize his/her intentions. 
                            The user can also start using the application with a general idea and read through the list to figure out what he/she really wants.
                        </p>
                        <p>The interviewees also expected the content of their message could also be analyzed and corrected based on their goals. 
                                And because the suggestions were real-time, problems could still happen in the entire message, especially with longer messages like emails. 
                                As a solution, the application will analyze the entire message in real-time and label the number of problems detected for the user to view and correct.
                        </p>
